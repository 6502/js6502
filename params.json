Current implementation\r\nworks only if the memory change is done using STA, STX, STY, INC or\r\nDEC.\r\n\r\nAnother shortcut is that \"special locations\" used for I/O do work\r\nonly if accessed using STA abs / LDA abs instructions (normally on\r\nhardware implementations any read/write triggers the special behavior)."}
