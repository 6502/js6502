Javascript emulator of 6502 CPU.

Not an interpreter, but a JIT compiler to javascript.

Includes a 6502 disassembler and a small assembler.

Work in progress... currently doesn't support code patching
(i.e. writing in the middle of a memory area that contains
code that was or is being executed... I'm still thinking how
to get that running reasonably fast).
